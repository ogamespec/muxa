Исторический очерк:

Naturalists of all ages have briefly referred to the habits and characteristics of the house-fly. Both Réaumur (1738) and De Gee'
(1758-78) included short accounts of this insect in their classica memoirs, but they contributed little to our knowledge of the structure or development of the fly.

The most comprehensive of the earlier accounts of the house fly was written by Gleichen (1790). This most interesting book of thirty-two quarto pages is illustrated by four very striking coloured plates which show the development of the fly and structural details, both external and inteirnal, of the fly and larva (fig. 2). The author gives a somewhat detailed account of the habits and development of the fly. It was natural that he should make some errors, such as mistaking the brown testes for the kidneys, in attempting to describe the anatomy at so early a date of our knowledge of morphology and methods of study. Notwithstanding these limitations, Gleichen's was still the most comprehensive and detailed account of the house-fly when I commenced to study the insect.

A short popular account of the house-fly was published, conjointly with that of the earth-worm, by Samuelson and Hicks in 1860, in a book entitled `Humble Creatures`. Though interesting, the account is very superficial and contains much that is inaccurate.

In 1874 Packard wrote a fairly complete account of the developmental history of the house-fly as observed in Massachusetts, U.S.A., and in 1880 Taschenberg gave a good popular account of the insect and its breeding habits in his `Praktische Tnsektenkunde`.

Howard gave a short account of the life-history of the house-fly in a bulletin on household insects, published in 1896 by the United States Department of Agriculture, and he gave a further account in 1900, in a valuable paper on the insect fauna of human excrement. Newstead, in 1907, gave a preliminary report of his study of the development and breeding-places of the house-fly in the city of Liverpool, and a second report was published in 1909.
